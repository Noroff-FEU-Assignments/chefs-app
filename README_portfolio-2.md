# JS Frameworks

![image](./src/images/chefs-ap_sc.jpg)

Course assignment for the lesson JS-Frameworks. 

## Description

The task was to make a React/Next app with a login functionality and specific functionalities for each path/page.
The project uses the JWT wordpress plugin and a private RESTapi that I have for my cooking blog. 
All paths are public except the /admin one, which doesn't appear in the navigation either. Also the plan is to use reusable components wherever is appropriate and to arrange nicely.

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
