Web-app for a restaurant to help the kitchen employees in their daily tasks

## Description

For now the app will help the chefs to gather their routines, prep-list, recipes and inventory in one place. Everything is connected to the api and the headchef can have control of
the functionalities from everywhere. The future plan for the app includes:
- Private api and dedicated database so that it can be used to more than one restaurant.
- Integrations of the external applications/links with functionalities of:
  - Making schedule.
  - Having forms to control food waste.
  - Deeper plan for routines (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Section for educational purposes and employee training.
- Immersion of the inventory to make it even sipmler to use (categorize per area).
